The following CSS code provides a corrected approach using `:nth-of-type`:

```css
li:nth-of-type(even) {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

This ensures that only list items are styled, correctly applying the background color to every other list item, regardless of the presence of other element types within the list.
